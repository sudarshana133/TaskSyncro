## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TaskSyncro.git
cd TaskSyncro
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration

To set up the project locally, you will need to configure your environment variables. These variables are required to connect the app to Appwrite and other services.

#### 3.1 Create the `.env.local` file

Copy the contents of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

#### 3.2 Set Your Environment Variables

Update the `.env.local` file with your actual credentials. You will need the following information:

- **Appwrite URL**: Your Appwrite instance URL
- **Appwrite Project ID**: The project ID for your Appwrite project
- **Database ID**: The ID of the Appwrite database you're using
- **Appwrite API Key**: A server API key for accessing Appwrite
- **Collection IDs**: IDs for your Appwrite collections (User, Module, Module Resources, Music Playlist, Songs)
- **Bucket ID**: The ID for storing media (if applicable)
- **Gemini Key**: Your Gemini API key for recommendations

Here is an example of the `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL=<your_appwrite_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=<your_appwrite_project_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE_ID=<your_database_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_SERVER_API_KEY=<your_appwrite_server_api_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_COLLECTION_ID=675338d90030e8b6b5a2
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODULE_COLLECTION_ID=675339eb002d49f65ba8
NEXT_PUBLIC_MODULE_RESOURCES_COLLECTION_ID=6757221400156b2646ed
NEXT_PUBLIC_MUSIC_PLAYLIST_COLLECTION_ID=675f3c7000165cfc2d26
NEXT_PUBLIC_SONGS_COLLECTION_ID=675f3d2b003691efb3d5
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUCKET_ID=<your_bucket_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_KEY=<your_gemini_key>
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once you have configured your `.env.local` file, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
